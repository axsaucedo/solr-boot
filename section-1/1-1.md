# Goals of course

* What solr is and how it compares to relational db
* Impart the level of understanding required to properly configure, implement and maintain Apache Solr for enterprise level applciation

# What is Solr?

* A standalone search platform based in Java
    - Fulltext processing
    - Support for numbers, full strings, locations, booleans
    - Highly scalable and fast
    - Open source
* Uses Lucene search library
* Interacts with other applications via HTTP using RESTful XML and JSON APIs

# Anatomy of a document

* Solr uses documents instead of tables
* Documents in index have a single shared schema
    - Docs are composed of fields, which are specifications of field types
    - Fields can be configured  for speed, space or recoverability
        + You can store even smaller, recovering later, etc
        + Store all data and recover later for highlighting matches, etc
* You can search multiple fields in a document by text matching, range value, boolean expressions

# Document vs Row

* Like a monolithic "Table"
    - All in our index is massive
    - Definition is the same for all doc
* All documents must accomodate all your data
    - Hence a single schema
* Data doesn't need to be normalized
    - Solr does the normalization for you
* Querying is field-selective
    - You can say I only want to see 3 fields out of 20 fields defined
        + Won't load other 17 fields like mysql would

# How relevance works: tf-idf

* Term frequency
    - Amount of probability mass a given term has
    - Calculated by counting the times a term is seen in a document, and dividing by the full count of all terms
* Inverse document frequency
    - A normalizing factor based on the full document set
    - The log of the count of documents in the index divided by the number of documents containing that term
* Relevance tf * idf

# How solr relevancy works

* tf-idf calculated over a document field
* Index-time and query-time boosts are calculated
    - Field relevance = tf-idf(term * soom-of-boosts
    - Boosts say what fields, documetns r terms are more important than others (more on that later)
* Score for a document is the sum of relevance for all fields queried
