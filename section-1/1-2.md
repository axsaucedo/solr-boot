# Why is solr good for search?

* Super scalable
    - Sharding, replication
    - Reliable and robust
    - Can split indices by specific value
    - bring together with dist. search
    - Can introduce master slave
        + master indexes, slaves are queried
            * Performance indexing is split for better performance
* Extremely fast
    - Multiple caching layers, highly optimization searching
    - Lucene does a lot of optimization
        + Querying cash
        + Filter querying cache
* Highly configurable
    - Can address business needs
    - Can rewrite part of solr to address 
* Backed by best practices in information retrieval

# More than just string matching

* Many terms in language can be conflated to a single term for more robust
    - Proximity detection, etc
    - "walk" vs "walked"; "dog" vs "dogs"
* More robust for proximity detection
    - "john walked" -> "john suddely walked"
* Snipetting for free
* Optimized compression for tokenized strings
* Grouping/faceting, etc

# Solr vs MySQL FULLTEXT

* Fulltext is not available for InnoDB tables
* FULLTEXT also calculates tf-idf against columns
    - High frequency terms are automatically stopwords
    - Solr allows configurability of stopwords instead
    - Neither strict or fuzzy proximity in FULLTEXT
* Solr scales horizontally for free; mysql doesn't
* FULLTEXT reads entire row; solr can read and return more selectively

# In other words

* If you need "good enough" search from text alread in your db, sql might work
* Chances are good youll run into wall
    - speed
    - scalability
    - robustnesss
* Solr gives greater control in teh long run for products


# DOn't worry

* Solr can easily consume data from your database
    - DataImportHandler
* Solr is functionally capable of most filtering and group use cases in MySQL
* JOIN is not available
    - Due to a different data architectural paradigm
